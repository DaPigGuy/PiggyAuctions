# PiggyAuctions [![Poggit-CI](https://poggit.pmmp.io/shield.dl/PiggyAuctions)](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/PiggyAuctions) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/330850307607363585?logo=discord)](https://discord.gg/qmnDsSD)

PiggyAuctions is an open-sourced auction house plugin for [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP) allowing players to place auctions and bid on items.

Why use PiggyAuctions over other competitors?
1. **BRAND LOYALTY!!!** PiggyAuctions is a quality Piggy-flavored plugin refined throughout generations of the Sus genus. You won't get to experience this authentic rich and savory flavor anywhere else. And, it's *free* bacon, what else could you ask for?
2. PiggyAuctions has bidding, searching, sorting, auto-refreshing, pagination, etc.
3. Oink? You're not going to install such an amazing plugin? üê∑
4. Sloths are scary.

## Prerequisites
* Basic knowledge on how to install plugins from Poggit Releases and/or Poggit CI
* PMMP 3.2.0 or greater
* mysql & sqlite3 PHP extensions (should already exist within your PHP binaries)
* Economy type supported by libPiggyEconomy:
  * [EconomyAPI](https://github.com/onebone/EconomyS/tree/3.x/EconomyAPI) by onebone
  * [MultiEconomy](https://github.com/TwistedAsylumMC/MultiEconomy) by TwistedAsylumMC
  * PMMP Player EXP

## Notice
You will need to download the [InvMenuFix](https://poggit.pmmp.io/r/94951/InvCrashFix_dev-1.phar) plugin and update your PiggyAuctions version to 1.0.6 to fix crates crashing your client.
 
## Installation & Setup
1. Install the plugin from Poggit.
2. (Optional) Setup the data provider that PiggyAuctions will be using. By default, PiggyAuctions will use SQLite3 which requires no additional setup. If you would like to use MySQL instead, change `database.type` from `sqlite` to `mysql` & enter your MySQL credentials under `database.mysql`.
3. (Optional) Setup your economy provider. If using EconomyAPI, this step can be skipped. Otherwise, change `economy.provider` to the name of the economy plugin being used, or `xp` for PMMP Player EXP. If using MultiEconomy, create `economy.multieconomy-currency` with the value being your preferred currency type.
4. (Optional) Certain user inputs for creating and bidding on auctions can be configured. By default, the duration limit is 14 days, while bid & starting bid limit are the 32 bit integer max. We recommend not allowing values over the 32 bit integer max (2^31 or 2147483648).
5. (Optional) You may configure messages in the `message.yml` file.
6. You're done! Start your server and begin auctioning items.
